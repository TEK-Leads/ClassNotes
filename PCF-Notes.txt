Pivotal Cloud Foundry Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------
1) Open run.pivotal.io website

2) Create Account (No Credit Card required)

3) Choose Pivotal Webservices

4) Select Free Trial

5) Create Org & Space (Org : Project Name) (Space: Env names)

One Org is equal to one project. 

One Project can contain multiple micro services.

One Space is equal to one environement.

One Org can contain Multiple spaces also

6) Download CF CLI software

7) Install Cloud Foundry CLI (Download as per OS)

8) After installation completed, open command prompt and verify CLI installation

Command: cf -version  : It should gv version details

Note: In Order to work with PCF using CLI, first we should login to CLI.

command : cf login

9) After login check target environment using below command

	command : cf target

10) Check apps available using below command 
	
	command : cf apps

11) CF Apps, Routes, Start and Stop commands

12) Push applicaiton to PCF using below command

	Command : cf push <app-name>
	Command : cf push <app-name> --randome-route

13) When we execute push command it checks for appropriate buildpacks to deploy application. If it is not able to detect buildpack then push operation will be failed.

14) To resolve that problem we can use below command

    Command : cf push <app-name> -p target/jarfilename.jar

Note: With the above command it detects java build pack to push


15) Once push operation is successful, go to PCF account and verify apps running.

16) It will display running apps under Org and Space and we can access application using app route url.

17) We can see all the routes available in our account using below command

     command : cf routes

18) We can change app route also using below command

  Command : 

cf map-route sbrestapp cfapps.io --hostname tekleads-first-sb-rest-api


19) Once Routing is completed we can access our application by using Routed URL also and old route also will work

	Ex : https://tekleads-first-sb-rest-api.cfapps.io/welcome
	     https://sbrestapp.cfapps.io/welcome

20) After Testing these urls we can stop our application using stop command
	
	Ex : cf stop <app-name>


21) If we want to push our application again, we should specify application name , route url , build pack etc... This is headache


22) To make push option easy, we can create app manifest file for our application. In that manifest file we can specify application-name, route url and buildpack details etc.


23) To create manifest file we can use below command

	command : cf create-app-manifest  <app-name>

	 	  cf create-app-manifest  SBRestApi


24) When we execute the above command it will create manifest file for our application (appname-manifest.yml)

25) We can see all application details in manifest.yml file

26) By default it will create file with application but the default name should be manifest.yml (rename it)

27) Configure path in manifest.yml (path: tareget/appjarfilename.jar)

28) After manifest file is created we can push application to PCF using below command

	Command : cf push
